******* For Proposed ********

******* Use two Auths *******
Client with Auth101, Server with Auth102

******* For resource-constrained Client ********
// sent packet (to server) or (to auth)
(tcp.dstport == 22100) || (tcp.dstport == 21900)
// received packet (from server) or (from auth)
(tcp.srcport == 22100) || (tcp.srcport == 21900)

******* For resource-constrained Server ********
// sent packet (to client) or (to auth)
(tcp.srcport == 22100) || (tcp.dstport == 22900)
// received packet (from client) or (from auth)
(tcp.dstport == 22100) || (tcp.srcport == 22900)



******* For SSL/TLS ********

******* For resource-constrained Client ********
// sent packet (to server) or (to auth)
tcp.dstport == 21100
// received packet (from server) or (from auth)
tcp.srcport == 21100

******* For resource-constrained Server ********
// sent packet (to server) or (to auth)
tcp.srcport == 21100
// received packet (from server) or (from auth)
tcp.dstport == 21100
