# Important directories and enviroment variables

**$REPO_ROOT**

* This directory serves as the root of the relevant repositories and contains all the necessary components for the experiments. It must include `iotauth`, `iotauth_experiments`, and `ns3`.

**$CONF (iotauth_experiments/expConfigs)**

* This directory includes scripts for generating the *ns3Exp.graph*, *devList.txt*, and *commCosts.txt* files using *.input* file which describes Auths and thing, including a list of Auths, a list of things (clients & servers), assignemts (Auth - thing registration), trust relationships between Auths, communication costs, and migration plans.
* To clone `iotauth_experiments` repository,
  
  ```
  cd $REPO_ROOT
  git clone https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth_experiments.git
  ```
  
**$IOT/examples (iotauth/examples)**

* This directory is for scripts to generate credentials, config files, and Auth databases using *.graph* file generated in $CONF.
* To clone `iotauth` repository,
  
  ```
  cd $REPO_ROOT
  git clone https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth.git
  ```

**$ENTITY ($IOT/entity/node/example_entities)**

* This directory includes example entities and their scripts used in experiments. They are launched in LXC containers during experiments using the $EXEC scripts.

**$AUTH ($IOT/auth/auth-server)**

* This direcotry includes the neccsary files to execute the Auths. 
  
**$LXC (iotauth_experiments/network_sim/linux_containers)**

* This directory includes scripts for generating other scripts to set up, start, stop, and teardown linux containers (LXC, para-virtualmachines). The generation script uses *devList.txt* and *commCosts.txt* files. See [LXC README.md](https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth_experiments/blob/master/network_sim/linux_containers/README.md) for more details.
  
**$NS3 (ns-3-dev)**

* A directory for running the ns-3 network simulator. The network model is under *$TAP* directory (*$NS3/src/tap-bridge/examples*). This simulation model connects linux containers (LXCs), therefore, the simulator must be running before we run LXCs.
* To download ns3,
  
  ```
  cd $REPO_ROOT
  git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git
  ```

**$TAP ($NS3/src/tap-bridge/examples)**

* This directory includes SST simulation models using tap bridges. Currently used simulation models are *tap-matrix-sst.cc* and *tap-mixed-sst.cc*. Other files include *comm-cost.h* for CommCost class and *tap-csma-sst.cc* which was used for experimenting wired connections for Auths.

**$EXEC (iotauth_experiments/network_sim/container_execution)**

* This directory is for actually executing linux containers (LXCs) for Auths, servers, and clinets. As a result of LXC execution, the execution logs are stored in subdirectories *auth_execution* for Auth logs, *server_execution* for server logs, and *client_execution* for client logs.

**$CCS (iotauth_experiments/experiments/ccs2017)**

* This directory includes options for exepriments under $CCS/expOptions and contains scripts for copying logs and packet captures (pcap) to $CCS/results directory and scripts for analyzing the results, including availability and expected energy consumption.

**$MOUNT_DIR**

* This directory specifies the host path mounted into each linux container, providing access to experimental files. It can be set to $REPO_ROOT to mount all the necessary repositories.

# Experiment procedure

* Generating an input for graph (**ns3Exp.input** as default, can be changed, others are **$CCS/floorPlans/cory5th.input**)

  * This takes coordinates for entities (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory5th.txt**), predefined Auth-entity assignments (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory5thAssignments.json**), predefined Auth trusts (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory5thAuthTrusts.json**), and predefined Auth capacity (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory5thAuthCapacity.json**).
    
    ```
    cd $CCS
    # Install required packages
    ./initConfigs.sh 
    # for help
    node floorPlanToInput.js --help
    # for generating floor plan with predefined assignments and Auth trusts
    node floorPlanToInput.js -a floorPlans/cory5thAssignments.json -t floorPlans/cory5thAuthTrusts.json -c floorPlans/cory5thAuthCapacity.json -o floorPlans/cory5th -b 3
    ```

* Experiment graph generation (**ns3Exp.graph** as default, can be changed)

  * This also generates **commCosts.txt** (communication costs between Auths and things) and **devList.txt** (a list of device information - name, address, type, position)
  * Internally uses *expGraphGenerator.js* and *graphInput.js*
    
    ```
    cd $CONF
    # Install required packages
    ./initConfigs.sh 
    # for help
    ./generateAll.sh --help
    # default local
    ./generateAll.sh 
    # With a given floor plan
    ./generateAll.sh -i $CCS/floorPlans/cory5th.input -o cory5th.graph
    ```

* To generate Auths and entities using graph.

  The Auth password is hardcoded as `asdf` in the source code for this experiment.
  
  ```
  cd $IOT/examples
  # Install required packages
  ./initConfigs.sh
  # Clean up existing Auths
  ./cleanAll.sh
  # Use 'asdf' as the password when creating the Auths.
  ./generateAll.sh -g $CONF/ns3Exp.graph
  ```

  * Run `make` if you have not built Auth jar before.
  
    ```
    cd $AUTH
    make
    ```

* To set linux containers (LXCs). **generateAll.sh** will generate **tapConfigs.txt** that is used for ns3 simulation. The setup takes some time. See [LXC README.md](https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth_experiments/blob/master/network_sim/linux_containers/README.md) for more details. Do not forget to teardown LXCs with "./teardown-virtual-network.sh" before you create a new set of LXCs. (If not, it will cause problems because of the LXCs that are already there).
  ```
  cd $LXC
  # Clean up existing LXCs
  sudo ./teardown-virtual-network.sh
  ./cleanAll.sh

  # Generate default configuration
  ./generateAll.sh -d $CONF/devList.txt
  # Generate configuration including communication cost relationships
  ./generateAll.sh -d $CONF/devList.txt -c $CONF/commCosts.txt

  # Set up LXCs
  sudo ./setup-virtual-network.sh
  ```

* To see current linux containers,
  ```
  sudo lxc-ls
  ```

* To setup ns3 network simulation environment (build is optional)

  * **IMPORTANT**: Before the first build of ns3, configure it to include examples and tests, enable sudo and python bindings, and optimize the build. Examples include modules for simulation, **tap-matrix-sst** and **tap-mixed-sst**.
    ```
    cd $NS3
    ./ns3 configure --build-profile=optimized --enable-examples --enable-tests --enable-sudo --enable-python-bindings
    ./ns3 build
    ```

  * To edit the simulator source code, see inside **$TAP** (**$NS3/src/tap-bridge/examples**) and look into simulation files (e.g., **tap-matrix-sst.cc**, **tap-mixed-sst.cc**)
    ```    
    # To use matrix propagation loss for wifi connections
    ./ns3 run "$TAP/tap-matrix-sst $LXC/tapConfigs.txt"
    
    # To use positions in x,y,z coordinates for wifi connections
    ./ns3 run "$TAP/tap-matrix-sst $LXC/tapConfigs.txt"
    ```

* To run linux containers (LXCs) for experiments

  * Initializes Auths, servers, and clients
  * Emulates failure of an Auth
  * Change owners of created log files
    ```
    # Use -E to inherit environmental variables
    sudo -E chroot /
    cd $EXEC
    ./start-exp.sh
    ```
    
  * To stop the experiment while it is still in progress
    ```
    ./stop-all.sh
    ```
    
  * To clean created logs, etc.
    ```
    ./cleanAll.sh
    ```
    
* To analyze results
  
  * Copy results (logs and pcap files) to a directory that will be created under $CCS/results/YYMMDD-HHMMSS, (this also copies config files used for the experiments under $CCS/results/YYMMDD-HHMMSS/configs to use them in analysis such as the given communication costs, addresses of communication targets, and names devices and TAPs. **NOTE: Don't run this analysis as a super user (root)!!**
    ```
    exit
    cd $CCS
    ./copyResults.sh
    ```

  * Analyze results for the given directory (e.g., results/YYMMDD-HHMMSS). Creates a directory called under results/YYMMDD-HHMMSS/analysis for storing analysis results (currently availability.txt and packet.txt)
    ```
    ./analyzeResult.sh [RESULT_DIR]
    ```

    cd server_execution

    node autoClient.js configs/Clients/t8.config 
    ```

    ```
    sudo lxc-stop -n auth1
    ```

# Experiment procedure for extended experiments for Cory 3rd, 4th and 5th floors (Cory345)

* Generating an input for graph (**ns3Exp.input** as default, can be changed, others are **$CCS/floorPlans/cory345.input**)

  * This takes coordinates for entities (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory345.txt**), predefined Auth-entity assignments (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory345Assignments.json**), predefined Auth trusts (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory345AuthTrusts.json**), predefined Auth capacity (**$CCS/floorPlans/cory345AuthCapacity.json**).
  
    ```
