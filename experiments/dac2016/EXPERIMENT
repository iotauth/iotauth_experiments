# Scenario II (publisher and subscribers)

# Wireshark instruction
-- In the menu bar, select Statistics -> Packet Lengths

-- Use filters to distinguish sent/received, e.g.
// sent from tls_client
tcp.dstport >= 41018 and tcp.dstport <= 41050
// received by tls_client
tcp.srcport >= 41018 and tcp.srcport <= 41050

// sent from proposed client -- be careful with the client side port for auth (it varies!)
(tcp.srcport == 58190) or (tcp.dstport >= 8125 and tcp.dstport <= 8150)
// received by proposed client
(tcp.dstport == 58190) or (tcp.srcport >= 8125 and tcp.srcport <= 8150)

// sent from tls_publisher
tcp.srcport == 41018
// received by tls_publisher
tcp.dstport == 41018

// sent from proposed publisher -- be careful with the client side port for auth (it varies!)
tcp.srcport == 58426 or tcp.srcport == 8125
// received by proposed publisher
tcp.dstport == 58426 or tcp.dstport == 8125

// sent from with broker publisher (to Auth or to Broker)
tcp.srcport == 58495 or tcp.srcport == 58517
// received by with broker publisher (from Auth or Broker)
tcp.dstport == 58495 or tcp.dstport == 58517
